# TRAIN SCHEDULE

This application allows you to track a train based on it's initial run time.

## How It Works

The application uses Firebase backend to store train data submitted by the user (admin). Based on the train's "First Train Time" and the train's "Frequency", data will be displayed to the screen to show how many minutes until the next train, and the time the train is expected to arrive.
